## Scroll Progress Bar Webpage

### Project Description:

This project is a **Scroll Progress Bar Webpage** designed to visually represent the user's scroll position on the page. As users scroll, a progress bar at the top of the page dynamically fills, indicating the percentage of the page that has been viewed. Developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this feature enhances user experience by providing a clear and intuitive way to track scrolling progress.

### Key Features:

1. **User Interface (UI):**
   - A clean and responsive design that integrates seamlessly into the webpage layout.
   - A progress bar at the top of the page that changes color and size dynamically as users scroll.

2. **Scroll Progress Indicator:**
   - Real-time calculation of the scroll percentage based on the user's position on the page.
   - The progress bar visually expands or contracts, providing immediate feedback on the scroll position.
   - Aesthetic design with a gradient color effect, making the progress bar visually appealing and easy to notice.

3. **JavaScript Functionality:**
   - Utilizes JavaScript to capture the scroll event and calculate the corresponding scroll percentage.
   - Updates the width of the progress bar in real time, reflecting the user's scrolling actions.
   - Ensures smooth transitions and accurate representation of the scroll progress.

4. **Enhanced Usability:**
   - Provides users with a visual cue of their scrolling progress, helping them navigate lengthy content.
   - Responsive design ensures that the progress bar functions correctly on both desktop and mobile devices.
   - Simple and non-intrusive, adding functionality without distracting from the content.

### Technologies Used:

- **HTML5:** Structure and layout of the webpage.
- **CSS3:** Styling, including the gradient effect and responsive design.
- **JavaScript:** Core logic for capturing scroll events and updating the progress bar.

### Outcome:

The Scroll Progress Bar Webpage improves user experience by offering a clear visual indication of scroll progress. This project demonstrates my ability to integrate front-end technologies to create functional and interactive web features that enhance usability and engagement.
